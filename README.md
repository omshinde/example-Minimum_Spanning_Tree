# example-Minimum_Spanning_Tree
This repository includes examples of Minimum Spanning Tree using Boost graph C++ library.

### Initial Task
- [x] Fork Boost Graph library from [https://github.com/boostorg/graph](https://github.com/boostorg/graph).
- [x] Understand Graph library and [read](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html).
- [ ] Assume some graphs from your own. Then try to draw Minimum Spanning Tree's using Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.
- [ ] Compile `kruskal-example.cpp` and `prim-example.cpp` present in example folder for the same graphs and check the output.
- [ ] If you succeed, then build upon these concepts to write code for `pgr_KruskalMST` and `pgr_PrimMST`.
